# pi-b-q

Project to programatically interact with a Thermoworks BlueTherm thermomoter.

Today this thing (sort of) does:
* Can request and interpret data from the BlueTherm
* Assumes BT connection and serial port is managed externally

Someday this thing may (or may not):
* Automatically connect to any paired BT device
* Continuously record temperature data
* Provide a web interface to view recorded and near real-time data
